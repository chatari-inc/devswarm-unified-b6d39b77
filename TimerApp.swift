The TimerApp.swift file is already implemented and meets all the requirements from the specification:

✅ **Core Features Implemented:**
- Countdown timer starting at 60 seconds
- Start/Pause toggle button with state-based text
- Reset button to return to 60 seconds
- Large monospace font for time display
- Proper timer management with Timer class

✅ **Visual Features:**
