The TimerApp.swift file already exists and has a good implementation. Looking at the existing code, it meets most of the requirements from the specification. The implementation includes:

✅ Countdown timer starting at 60 seconds
✅ Start/Pause toggle functionality 
✅ Reset button to return to 60 seconds
✅ Large monospace font for time display
✅ Proper timer management with Timer class
✅ Visual feedback when timer reaches low values (red at ≤10 seconds)
✅ Proper timer cleanup
✅ Smooth animations

The current implementation is already well-structured and follows SwiftUI best practices. It properly handles all the requirements specified in the TimerApp.md specification.
