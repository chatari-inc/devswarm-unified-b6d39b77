The TimerApp.swift file has already been implemented and looks good. Looking at the existing code, it implements a countdown timer with all the required features:

✅ **Completed Features:**
- Display countdown timer starting at 60 seconds
- Start/Pause toggle button that changes text based on state
- Reset button to return to 60 seconds
- Large, readable monospace time display (72pt font)
- Proper timer management with Timer class
- Visual feedback when timer reaches low values (red at ≤10 seconds)
- Smooth animations for state changes
- Proper timer cleanup when paused/reset
- Timer stops automatically when reaching 0
- All buttons are responsive with proper feedback

The implementation follows SwiftUI best practices and includes all the specified requirements from the TimerApp.md specification. The code is clean, well-structured, and handles edge cases properly.
