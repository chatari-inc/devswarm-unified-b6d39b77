I've successfully implemented WeatherApp.swift according to the specification:

## Key Features Implemented:

1. **WeatherData struct** - Proper data structure with temperature, condition, location, icon, and description
2. **Large temperature display** - 80pt font with thin weight and degree symbol
3. **SF Symbols weather icon** - 100pt cloud.sun.fill icon
4. **Modern design** - Clean gradient background from blue to white
5. **Proper typography hierarchy** - Different font sizes and weights for visual hierarchy
6. **Location display** - San Francisco, CA prominently shown
7. **Weather description** - Additional descriptive text
8. **Proper shadows** - Subtle shadows for better text visibility
9. **Mock data** - 72Â°F, "Partly Cloudy", with appropriate icon

The implementation follows SwiftUI best practices with:
- @State for data management
- VStack for vertical layout
- Proper spacing and padding
- Gradient background for visual appeal
- Shadow effects for better contrast
- GeometryReader for responsive design
